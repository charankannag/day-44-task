JSON web token (JWT), pronounced "jot", is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and 
self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
 Again, JWT is a standard, meaning that all JWTs are tokens, 
but not all tokens are JWTs.
Custom Middleware
Middleware is software that's assembled into an app pipeline to handle requests and responses. 
ASP.NET Core provides a rich set of built-in middleware components, but in some scenarios you might want to write a custom middleware. 
This topic describes how to write convention-based middleware.
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

module.exports = (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const token = req.headers.authorization.split(' ')[1];
    const decodedToken = jwt.verify(token, 'RANDOM_TOKEN_SECRET');
    const userId = decodedToken.userId;
    if (req.body.userId && req.body.userId !== userId) {
      throw 'Invalid user ID';
    } else {
      next();
    }
  } catch {
    res.status(401).json({
      error: new Error('Invalid request!')
    });
  }
};
